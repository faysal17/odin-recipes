    <h3>A Scotch egg made with chicken</h3>
    <h4><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>4 hard-boiled eggs</li>
        <li>one-fourth cup breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. milk</li>
        <li>500g ground chicken</li>
        <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>a little black pepper</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4><strong>STEPS</strong></h4>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Make chicken drumsticks "tulips." Use kitchen scissors to cut the meat loose from the handle end of the drumsticks.
        Roll the meat down the bone until it is fully inside-out at the end.</p></li>
        <li><p>Soak the breadcrumbs in milk. Knead mix in a bowl, then add breadcrumbs and knead again.</p></li>
        <li><p>Fold the meaty end of the drumsticks around a hard-boiled egg. If the meat doesn't cover well enough, add cuts to loosen it up. Oil hands lightly and cover drumsticks and egg with the breadcrumbs mixture.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake at 400F for 15-20 minutes, watching carefully.</p></li>
    </ol>
